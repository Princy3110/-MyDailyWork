## Introduction

Credit card fraud detection is a crucial challenge in the financial sector. With the increase in digital transactions, the risk of fraudulent activities has escalated, making it imperative to develop robust models that can detect fraud in real-time.

This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a model that distinguishes between fraudulent and legitimate credit card transactions based on historical data.

## Dataset

Name: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

Source: Kaggle

## Description: 
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It has 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions, showing a high class imbalance.

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
* Handling Missing Values: Identified and handled missing values (if any).
* Normalization: Standardized numerical features for better model performance.
* Class Imbalance: Addressed using techniques like SMOTE and undersampling.
2. Model Training
Implemented models including Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
Used techniques like GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

3. Model Evaluation
Evaluated using metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
Conducted cross-validation to ensure model robustness.

## Results

Best Model: Random Forest achieved the best balance between precision and recall.

Performance Metrics:

Precision: 0.91

Recall: 0.89

F1-Score: 0.90

ROC-AUC: 0.97

## Future Work

Deploy the Model: Using a web framework like Flask or FastAPI for real-time fraud detection.

Explore Advanced Algorithms: Investigate ensemble methods like XGBoost or LightGBM.

Feature Engineering: Develop more sophisticated features to improve model performance.
